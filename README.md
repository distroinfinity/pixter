# PIXTERS

The idea behind Pixters is to allow user to mint dynamic avatars as NFTs 👾 Which they can customise all they want (even after minting ✨) and use them as PFPs on social or anywhere else that they would use a regular NFT.

Pixters gives you the freedom to mint an avatar just once and keep on customising it later as per your mood XD

Currently Pixters is live on Polygon & Polygon Mumbai 🚀

It is built using [scaffold-eth 2 🏗️](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)
