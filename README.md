# PIXSTER

The idea behind Pixters is to allow user to mint dynamic avatars as NFTs. Which they can customise all they want(even after minting) and use them as PFPs on social or anywhere else that they would use a regular NFT.

Pixters gives you they freedom to mint an Avatar just once and keep on customising it later as per your mood XD

Currently Pixters is live on Polygon Mumbai
